<p>This calendar shows any planned maintenance, or unplanned outages for assignr.com.  Most other sites only include unplanned outages when they calculate an uptime percentage.  Our uptime percentages are a "true" measure of our up-time, and they include both planned and unplanned maintenance.  We don't think it matters whether we planned to be offline or not. </p>
<% if Time.zone.now < Time.zone.parse("2012-08-01")%>
  <p>We had a major outage in August, and several other related unplanned outages in September. In October we moved from a single server to a multiple-server cluster, which has significantly improved our up-time record.</p>
